<h1> Historical Facts about Polar Bears </h1>
</center>
<p> Climate change is one of the many reasons leading to polar bear extinction. Polar bears rely on
sea ice in fall and summer when food can be scarce but now sea ice melts in earlier spring and forms 
in later fall. So the bears are spending longer periods of time without food which is causing their 
health to decline. Unhealthy bears are leading to lower reproduction rates and more deaths of cubs
with the lack of food and fat on nursing mothers.
